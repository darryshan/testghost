They are the critical point that people who potentially want to buy something from you will encounter the option to do so. They should be simple to explore, clear, helpful, and hopefully &#x2013; exciting. </p><p>To design a paywall that will convert your users into paying customers, there are a few important things you should take into account. You&apos;ll want to...</p><ol><li>Understand your audience</li><li>Choose the right paywall model</li><li>Clarify any requirements</li><li>Observe what others are doing</li></ol><p>Let&apos;s jump into the first one - understanding your audience, and why that matters.</p><h2 id="understand-your-audience">Understand Your Audience</h2><p>No two paywalls are the same. Or at least, no two paywalls <em>should </em>be the same. Knowing, or at least having some idea, of who you&apos;re designing for is important. </p><p>I won&apos;t spend time going into the importance of user research, defining personas, or mapping user journeys right now, but what is important to know is that different people respond differently to different things.</p><p>Mind-blowing, I know.</p><p>But the crux of this is that, as a user, your state of mind and self-image describe exactly if a paywall will speak to you or not. And speaking to you means conveying if you&apos;re in the right place, that this is value worth paying for, and that you&apos;ll feel good and not like crap after giving someone else your money.</p><p>And this effect will source differently for different people.</p><p>Imagine, for example, two different people: the busy executive assistant purchasing a private jet service for their ego-driven boss, and a stay-at-home parent signing up for a grocery delivery service.</p><p>Think about their motivations. What&apos;s important to them? And crucially, when they&apos;re evaluating their purchase, how do they want it to make them <em>feel</em>? </p><p>When you begin to answer those questions for <em>your </em>audience, it becomes clear that recycling designs will come with varying mileage.</p><p>Designing effectively is important. And for paid products, the paywall is where it&apos;s at. It&apos;s you, the person who has something valuable to sell, meeting the customer in the exact moment that they may want to purchase something valuable from you. And in that moment, you&apos;d better be dressed to the 9&apos;s. As they say.</p><p>So as you move forward in your paywall journey, keep that in mind. When you have an idea of who will be seeing, and evaluating, if your product is worth their money, it&apos;s time to choose which model makes sense for your product.</p><h2 id="choose-a-model">Choose a model</h2><p>There are a few different types of paywalls that you might use depending on the type of content you&apos;re pay-walling and your user behaviors.</p><p>In a nutshell, the different models are:</p><h3 id="hard-paywall">Hard paywall</h3><p>This type of paywall blocks users from consuming any content before paying. Typically this is most effective for brands that have high user awareness, ie, many of your potential customers will be well aware of and decided-on the value of your paid offering.</p><h3 id="freemium">Freemium</h3><p>In a freemium model, some content is free, and some is paid and locked away. This can be beneficial in that it lets your potential customers &quot;sample&quot; the quality of your product before buying. However, it can also mean that people who are less engaged may never purchase.</p><h3 id="metered">Metered</h3><p>Under this model, a user is allowed a certain quanity of content before they are blocked. This likely results in users getting the benefits of a freemium paywall, but with content of their choosing, which may lead to higher pre-purchase engagement, leading to potentially higher overall conversion.</p><h3 id="dynamic">Dynamic</h3><p>The dynamic model is a form of the metered paywall that behaves uniquely per user. Ie, if the data indicates you&apos;re an engaged user, it may trigger a paywall at a different point than if you seem to be less engaged and therefore less likely to purchase down the road if not prompted sooner.</p><p><strong>Why it&apos;s important</strong></p><p>The reason it&apos;s important to take stock of your paywall model is that it is a product decision that needs to be made before you start designing, and one that will also most likely very much define success for, and inform, the resulting design.</p><p>For the sake of this article, let&apos;s assume that the product decisions have been made, and that you&apos;ve selected your paywall model, and are now just concerned about the presentation of your product offerings.</p><p>It&apos;s time to figure out exactly what information you need to deal with in the design. The next section will help you identify those requirements, and more importantly, start thinking of questions you&apos;ll need to get answers to before you jump into the design.</p><h2 id="clarify-requirements">Clarify requirements</h2><p>This is where it&apos;s helpful to make a list of everything you need in your design.</p><p>Questions you might want answers to eventually might include:</p><ul><li>Are there different product offerings or price tiers with distinct benefits or levels of access?</li><li>If so, how many are there, and what are they?</li><li>Are certain product offerings more important than others?</li><li>Is there existing copy or imagery that is non-negotiable and needs to be included? (for example, legal disclaimers)</li><li>Are you offering different payment periods? Do they affect the cost (is there a discount for a specific payment period?)</li><li>Do you know anything about existing customers? For example - which seems to resonate the most with your existing users?</li><li>If not, which would you imagine might?</li><li>Is there any functionality you need to feature?</li></ul><p>Once you get your requirements as close to crystal clear as possible (there&apos;s always some give and take during the design process, but establishing as much of this up front as possible helps streamline things down the road,) you&apos;re ready to start designing.</p><h2 id="observe-observe-observe">Observe, observe, observe</h2><p>There are many successful products out there doing things right. While I&apos;m not advocating for copying a design piece for piece, learning and <em>understanding </em>the underlying mechanics of what makes successful paywalls successful is the most effective thing you can do to get an idea of how you should design yours.</p><p>Take the pieces that seem to be working well, apply them to your audience and brand, and the result will be something bespoke and effective.</p><p>Some paywalls that have created massive success for their companies:</p><h3 id="tinder-gold">Tinder Gold</h3><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/2023/03/image.png" class="kg-image" alt="Design an effective paywall" loading="lazy" width="1135" height="1689" srcset="https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/size/w600/2023/03/image.png 600w, https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/size/w1000/2023/03/image.png 1000w, https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/2023/03/image.png 1135w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo credit: <strong>Maverick4840 (reddit)</strong></figcaption></figure><p></p><p></p><h3 id="canva">Canva</h3><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/2023/03/image-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="Design an effective paywall" loading="lazy" width="800" height="1732" srcset="https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/size/w600/2023/03/image-1.png 600w, https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/2023/03/image-1.png 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo credit: www.namiml.com</figcaption></figure><h3 id="buzzfeed">Buzzfeed</h3><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/2023/03/image-2.png" class="kg-image" alt="Design an effective paywall" loading="lazy" width="800" height="1626" srcset="https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/size/w600/2023/03/image-2.png 600w, https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/2023/03/image-2.png 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo credit: www.namiml.com</figcaption></figure>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[6 Figma Features That Will Save You a Ton of Time]]></title><description><![CDATA[These Figma pro tips will save you a ton of time and help you become a faster and more confident designer.]]></description><link>https://www.theuilab.co/6-figma-timesavers/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">6363f2e16b70c6003de29321</guid><category><![CDATA[Figma]]></category><category><![CDATA[Blog]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Gareth]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 11 Nov 2022 00:50:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/2022/11/Figma-Timesavers-5.png" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/2022/11/Figma-Timesavers-5.png" alt="6 Figma Features That Will Save You a Ton of Time"><p>I was intimidated the first time I had to use Figma. Before Figma, my UI design world existed within Sketch, Adobe XD, even sometimes Adobe Illustrator.</p><p>Figma was a completely different way of doing things; all the panels and tools were in different places, it almost felt <em>empty </em>in a way, not to mention all of the sudden I was designing collaboratively live with other people.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/2022/11/looking-around.gif" class="kg-image" alt="6 Figma Features That Will Save You a Ton of Time" loading="lazy" width="498" height="247"><figcaption>Hey uh. Where are the text tools?</figcaption></figure><p>Over time, I&apos;ve learned a lot of the hidden and nuanced functionality built into Figma that makes design a <em>lot </em>easier. Almost exclusively because of all the little things, I went from being a skeptical adopter to a strong advocate.</p><p><strong>These are some of my favorite hidden or semi-hidden functionalities that I use all the time:</strong></p><ol><li>Use an 8 point grid</li><li>Change the nudge size to match your grid</li><li>Use the special Paste tools</li><li>Quick-select an object within a group</li><li>Use Selection Colors to change all instances of a color</li><li>Copy and paste layer effects</li></ol><h2 id="use-a-grid-or-layout-system">Use a grid or layout system</h2><p>The basic principle of using a grid is to use a multiple of a single number to dictate all sizing, spacing, padding, margins. </p><p><strong>I&apos;m a big fan of 8pt grid </strong>- it&apos;s very commonly used and friendly to many common screen sizes.</p><p>This means <strong>all of your sizes, spacing, padding, and margins will be multiples of 8</strong>: (8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, and so on.)</p><p>I&apos;ll spare you the snobby lecture and hot-take on why true designers do or don&apos;t use grids. This is a turtleneck-free zone.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/2022/11/giphy-5.gif" class="kg-image" alt="6 Figma Features That Will Save You a Ton of Time" loading="lazy" width="480" height="270"><figcaption>We get it. Grids are divine.</figcaption></figure><p>In reality, the reasons why you should use a grid aren&apos;t actually that complicated. <strong>The benefits of using a grid come down to this:</strong></p><ol><li>Less time spent measuring</li><li>Less guessing and remembering how much padding or spacing to use in new scenarios</li><li>Less time and energy spent &quot;feeling out&quot; what looks good </li><li>Fewer &quot;design typo&quot; type mistakes</li><li>More time spent confidently designing</li></ol><p>Have you ever spent time trying to split a bill up amongst friends in your head, missed something or realized you weren&apos;t able to hold one of the numbers in your head, and then had to go back and do it all over again? No one enjoys this process. Not you, not the other people at the table. This is what calculators are for.</p><p>Grids are like calculators for design. They make it easier for you to be consistent when doing common, repetitive, and BORING, but <em>important,</em> stuff &#x2014; like making your padding and sizing consistent. </p><p>Who wants to spend <em>more</em> time making sure their padding is consistent? No one ever.</p><p>Who messes it up or misses things when they try to do repetitive and focus-intensive tasks manually? Everyone always.</p><p><strong>Here&apos;s the thing: you shouldn&apos;t feel bad about being inconsistent in the first place, but you <em>should</em> strive to be consistent.</strong></p><p>We are not calculators &#x2014; we&apos;re human beings; we&apos;re fleshy, squishy, messy creatures. We <em>use </em>calculators. And we also didn&apos;t evolve in symmetrical, digital spaces.</p><p>Our brains just weren&apos;t made to accurately create dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of perfectly-spaced objects. When you think about it, it&apos;s pretty <em>weird</em>. </p><p>Unless you&apos;re some kind of strange and questionable personality, it&apos;s hard <em>and</em> it&apos;s uninteresting to do this kind of work while maintaining your accuracy, which is a great combo if you want to get less done and hate the time you spent doing it and end up with a lot of mistakes.</p><p>Not to mention if you&apos;re the one building what you or someone else designed, you <em>also </em>don&apos;t want to be spending your time guessing, measuring, or having to ask the designer every time something isn&apos;t clear.</p><p>And this kind of spacing isn&apos;t a good look or helpful for anyone:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/2022/11/messy-sizing.png" class="kg-image" alt="6 Figma Features That Will Save You a Ton of Time" loading="lazy" width="1754" height="622" srcset="https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/messy-sizing.png 600w, https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/size/w1000/2022/11/messy-sizing.png 1000w, https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/size/w1600/2022/11/messy-sizing.png 1600w, https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/2022/11/messy-sizing.png 1754w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>13.73 pixels.

They&apos;re a nice little speed boost to your workflow, especially if you or your team aren&apos;t using a design system.</p><h3 id="paste-here">Paste here</h3><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><code>Paste here</code> lets you paste an object directly where your cursor is, like this:</p>

It&apos;s both simple and incredibly flexible, and therefore, powerful. Paste to replace allows you to replace selected elements, with elements you copied to the clipboard. </p><p>Here&apos;s how you do it:</p><ol><li>Copy the element</li><li>Select element(s) you want to replace</li><li>Past to replace:</li></ol><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><strong>Mac:</strong> <code>CMD</code> <code>Option</code> <code>Shift</code> <code>V</code><br>

It&apos;s great.</p><h2 id="select-objects-within-a-group">Select Objects Within a Group</h2><p>When you have a lot of grouped objects, it can be tiresome to double-click your way into selecting the element you want. Fortunately, there&apos;s a shortcut.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>All you have to do is hold <code>Cmd</code> if you&apos;re on Mac, or <code>Ctrl</code> if you&apos;re on Windows.</p>

Especially if you&apos;re not using a design system, the ability to quickly change colors of multiple ungrouped elements on the fly is huge. This means you can adjust multiple elements at the same time, without having to select each one individually: </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/2022/11/selection-colors.gif" class="kg-image" alt="6 Figma Features That Will Save You a Ton of Time" loading="lazy" width="600" height="375" srcset="https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/2022/11/selection-colors.gif 600w"></figure><p>On a larger scale, it means you can select a frame and change every instance of that color on the whole screen:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/2022/11/selection-colors-frame.gif" class="kg-image" alt="6 Figma Features That Will Save You a Ton of Time" loading="lazy" width="600" height="468" srcset="https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/2022/11/selection-colors-frame.gif 600w"></figure><p>So much time saved by not going into each element and changing its color. The next major level up of this boost is to use a design system, which I&apos;ll cover in another lesson.</p><p>And that brings me to the final tip for this list:</p><h2 id="copy-and-paste-layer-effects">Copy and Paste Layer Effects</h2><p>Layer effects are things like drop shadows, background blurs, layer blurs, and so on. They&apos;re useful and common in UI design, so it&apos;s valuable to know how to reproduce them quickly without having to remake them or remember your custom values.</p><p>Once again, you can actually save and reuse layer styles by creating a Figma library (aka reusable design system,) but for the purpose of this post I&apos;ll show you how to quickly copy and paste them across elements.</p><p><strong>All you have to do to paste layer effects is is:</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ol>
<li>Select the layer whose styles you want to copy</li>
<li>Click the space just to the left of the effect you want to copy (you can use <code>Shift</code> + <code>click</code> to select multiple)</li>
<li>Use <code>Cmd/Ctrl</code> + <code>C</code> to copy the effect</li>
<li>Select the new layer, and use <code>Cmd/Ctrl</code> + <code>V</code> to paste the effect onto it</li>
</ol>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p><strong>Which looks like this:</strong></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/2022/11/paste-layer-effects.gif" class="kg-image" alt="6 Figma Features That Will Save You a Ton of Time" loading="lazy" width="600" height="384" srcset="https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/2022/11/paste-layer-effects.gif 600w"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>You can also copy and paste layer effects via the <code>right click menu</code> or by using <code>Cmd/Ctrl</code> + <code>Option/Alt</code> + <code>C</code> and <code>Cmd/Ctrl</code> + <code>Option/Alt</code> + <code>V</code>. It&apos;s worth noting, however, that this will also copy other properties like corner radius:</p>

It will &#x2014; I promise I&apos;m not exaggerating &#x2014; make you a better UI designer.</p><p>When you design an app for a phone, <em>on</em> a phone, you&apos;re removing one more layer of interpretation that your brain has to do to imagine it in context.</p><p><strong>The closer you can get to creating a 1:1 relationship between the context you&apos;re designing <em>for</em> and the context you&apos;re designing <em>in</em>, the better your designs will be.</strong></p><p>For those of you who have used an earlier Wacom or similar device and switched to an iPad Pro or similar device (again: once the technology of the iPad-like-device became close enough to a 1:1 experience,) it&apos;s like going from this:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/2022/10/firos-nv-58c1dnakdRQ-unsplash.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="How To Use Figma Mirror To Design on Your Phone" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/size/w600/2022/10/firos-nv-58c1dnakdRQ-unsplash.jpg 600w, https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/size/w1000/2022/10/firos-nv-58c1dnakdRQ-unsplash.jpg 1000w, https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/size/w1600/2022/10/firos-nv-58c1dnakdRQ-unsplash.jpg 1600w, https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/size/w2400/2022/10/firos-nv-58c1dnakdRQ-unsplash.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>To this:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/2022/10/cristofer-maximilian-PP1yKpfA4HY-unsplash.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="How To Use Figma Mirror To Design on Your Phone" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1161" srcset="https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/size/w600/2022/10/cristofer-maximilian-PP1yKpfA4HY-unsplash.jpg 600w, https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/size/w1000/2022/10/cristofer-maximilian-PP1yKpfA4HY-unsplash.jpg 1000w, https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/size/w1600/2022/10/cristofer-maximilian-PP1yKpfA4HY-unsplash.jpg 1600w, https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/size/w2400/2022/10/cristofer-maximilian-PP1yKpfA4HY-unsplash.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>I know there will be diehard Wacom holdouts out there that will come after me for this comment. But. Once the refresh rate and pressure sensitivity of iPads caught up to the point of diminishing returns relative to the Wacom, the iPad provided an objectively better experience overall. </p><p>And this is because it closed the gap across screen quality, pressure levels, and response time, creating a near 1:1 experience for digital drawing and painting.</p><blockquote class="kg-blockquote-alt"><strong>The closer you can get to creating a 1:1 relationship between the context you&apos;re designing <em>for</em> and the context you&apos;re designing <em>in</em>, the better your designs will be.</strong></blockquote><p>In the Figma app, not only can you see the changes you make in the right context (on the phone) as you make them, but you can also interact with your designs as you design them.</p><p>Meaning, if you&apos;re designing an app and you&apos;ve wired up your screens to be interactive, you can use it similar to how you&apos;d use the actual app.</p><p>Even better: this means <em>other people</em> can use the screens you&apos;re working on as if it&apos;s in an actual app, so the feedback you get will <em>also </em>be nearly 1:1 with what it would be if they were using the actual app.</p><p>So without further ado, let&apos;s start out by downloading the Figma app. Here are the respective links for each platform:</p><p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/figma-and-figjam/id1152747299?ref=theuilab.co">Figma for iPhone</a></p><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.figma.mirror&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US&amp;ref=theuilab.co">Figma for Android</a></p><p><strong>Once you&apos;ve got the app downloaded, you need to know two things:</strong></p><ol><li>It requires you to be signed into the same Figma account on both your phone and computer</li><li>It used to require you to be on the same wi-fi network. Now it doesn&apos;t, but I&apos;d recommend it anyway, since it will use a lot of data otherwise.</li></ol><p>Now that you&apos;re signed into the app and into your Figma account on your computer, you can simply click a frame to select it.</p><p><strong>Important note:</strong> you should use a frame size that matches your phone. This is important because your elements will not be sized correctly if you don&apos;t. If you don&apos;t know, here&apos;s how you set that.</p><p><strong>Why this is important:</strong> imagine designing in a tablet-sized screen size, and then viewing it on your phone: all of those pixels will just be scaled down to fit within the viewport of your phone, so you won&apos;t be getting an accurate read on the sizing of your elements.</p><p><strong>To do this, first select the Frame tool in the upper left. You can also press F on your keyboard. </strong></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/2022/11/Frame-tool.png" class="kg-image" alt="How To Use Figma Mirror To Design on Your Phone" loading="lazy" width="904" height="310" srcset="https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/Frame-tool.png 600w, https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/2022/11/Frame-tool.png 904w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><div class="kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-green"><div class="kg-callout-emoji">&#x26A1;</div><div class="kg-callout-text">Ps- If you haven&apos;t already, start learning those hotkeys!

But using hotkeys in combination with my mouse has <em>seriously</em> sped up my workflow.</div></div><p>Once you have the Frame tool selected, check out the top right of the Figma screen. You&apos;ll get a list of frame sizes for common devices:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/2022/11/Figma-frame-sizes.png" class="kg-image" alt="How To Use Figma Mirror To Design on Your Phone" loading="lazy" width="1784" height="1798" srcset="https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/size/w600/2022/11/Figma-frame-sizes.png 600w, https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/size/w1000/2022/11/Figma-frame-sizes.png 1000w, https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/size/w1600/2022/11/Figma-frame-sizes.png 1600w, https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/2022/11/Figma-frame-sizes.png 1784w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>They do a pretty good job of updating this list.

The setup process is the same as the one we just did; just make elements into an interactive prototype in Figma, and you&apos;ll be able to see them as you design <em>and </em>tap to use them.</p><p>Once you get the hang of it, using Figma mirror to design on your phone will change how you think about mobile app design. You can start designing as if you are designing an app in real time, rather than designing a picture of an app that will then be built into one.</p><p>It&apos;ll save you time translating your designs to workable sizes, gives you a better sense of how your colors will appear on a modern phone screen, and forces you to consider the usability of your design immediately and proactively rather than retroactively.</p><p>The cherry on top: handing someone a UI designed and having them use it right in front of you is a way more efficient way to get feedback on your designs.</p><p>When you design on your phone, there are fewer layers of interpretation and less suspense-of-disbelief required. Less imagining, and more doing the next thing. </p><p><strong>Bottom line: it will make you more efficient designer overall, and I&apos;d highly recommend it.</strong></p><p>Happy designing! &#x26A1;</p><p><em>Was this article helpful?

But for much of my time as a designer, I didn&#x2019;t really understand <em>how</em> it worked. &#xA0;It always kind of reminded me of one of these:<br></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/2022/10/gif-opt.gif" class="kg-image" alt="How To Use the Figma Color Picker" loading="lazy" width="250" height="274"><figcaption>Although fun, it&apos;s not particularly useful.</figcaption></figure><p>Like, hey, let&apos;s just sort of feel around a bit until we get something we like. I understood the basics, like moving the color slider around, and the fact that that the more you move it toward one color (from red to orange, for example), the more of that color would start to blend into the color you already had selected.</p><p>But at some point, I got frustrated by feeling like I wasn&apos;t really <em>getting </em>it. I felt like there had<em> </em>to be more to it. Was everyone<em> </em>using it like an ouija board like I was, sitting semi-aimlessly, hopelessly trying to summon the color spirits?<br></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/2022/10/13d585854801e879b7f3620e86ac961d.gif" class="kg-image" alt="How To Use the Figma Color Picker" loading="lazy" width="500" height="326"><figcaption>Casper the unfriendly ghost.</figcaption></figure><p>Turns out, like most things that seem like magic, there is more to the color picker than meets the eye. And by learning the basic mechanics of how it worked, I realized that I could start to reproducibly choose colors and accomplish what I was trying to accomplish both faster <em>and </em>more accurately. As you might imagine, that sped up my workflow by&#x2026; well, a bunch.</p><p>Using the color picker like a pro is a great boost to your productivity in Figma, as well as your confidence in your UI design ability. And it&#x2019;s not actually that complicated &#x2013; you only have to learn how it works once.</p><p>By the end of this short workshop, you&#x2019;ll be feeling confident in your Figma color picking abilities.

It felt like people who were good at using color were tapping into some sort of unicorn blood-fueled black magic, and that no matter how hard I tried, I&#x2019;d never be able to do what they did. And for context, I was feeling this way <em>with a graphic design background</em>! </p><p>Truthfully, using color in user interfaces does require some specific knowledge, but it&#x2019;s far from black magic. I wish I had someone to sit down with me and tell me what I <em>actually </em>need to know, because all I had at the time was my own anxiety and a handful of &#x201C;designery&#x201D; articles about color theory and the golden ratio.</p><p>The truth is, like all skills in life, it&#x2019;s not hard to do, you just have to learn it. And if I can learn it, you can learn it &#x2014; and neither of us even has to hunt a unicorn to do it. And I&#x2019;ll do you one even better: once it starts to click, it can be <em>fun</em>.</p><p>Let me caveat here for a second: I&#x2019;m not going to go super deep into color theory or get too theoretical. This article is meant to be <em>practical</em>, not exhaustive. It&#x2019;s my hope that by the end of this article, you&#x2019;ll feel more confident to start experimenting with color yourself.</p><p><strong>I&#x2019;ll cover things like:</strong></p><ul><li><strong><strong><strong>How important color is for UI design</strong></strong></strong></li><li><strong><strong><strong>What colors to use in your UI and when</strong></strong></strong></li><li><strong><strong><strong>How many colors you should use when designing a UI</strong></strong></strong></li><li><strong><strong><strong>How to know if your UI color choices look good</strong></strong></strong></li></ul><p>And I&#x2019;ll include examples to help you actually see some of this stuff in action. But quickly before I go into that, I want you to keep something in mind:</p><h2 id="color-is-surprisingly-flexible">Color is surprisingly flexible</h2><p>When I went to design school, I learned that you generally want to avoid colors that clash or create a sense of vibration (for example, light blues and oranges.) But let&#x2019;s take a moment to a look at this crazy use of color:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/wje0NaVKIuK7HvlZ76hi4NGPQjmbVnXY5Q3rkqwD06M0Yu04l3DVnd6ZRWYdSgnq91WLrMV_SYAdyKA_pU_DoFoVTCyHKuJAIubWNaPMHgzL6OfjDaJvdhNRIaoOhG5pNy1AdqNasLCmH2IpTZQIkYHDSpBhynxTZx4QTlWzf0gVDPLPEYdcM0VKTw" class="kg-image" alt="The UI Designer&apos;s Guide to Color: 2022" loading="lazy" width="624" height="432"></figure><p>The blue stripes inside the orange pants absolutely <em>shatter </em>the traditional take on what I learned about color. But somehow&#x2026; it works? Magic. For the moment, I want you to throw out everything you thought you knew about color. To learn color, you need to experiment.</p><p>It&#x2019;s important to keep in mind the context in which you&#x2019;re using color. This example is an illustration, and therefore it has a different ruleset. When you use color in your UI designs, you want to use color more precisely. And whereas our friend Sebastian here probably actually <em>intended </em>to create a muddy/vibrant effect, we do not necessarily want our button text to feel that way; we want ours to be readable. <strong>Main point here? Color is weird</strong>. And cool.</p><h2 id="how-important-is-color-to-ui-design"><strong>How important is color to UI design?</strong></h2><p>Let me just be super straightforward here to dispel a myth, and hopefully save you some time: <strong>color impacts our emotions</strong>. You can fast-forward through the debate about whether color theory &#x201C;works&#x201D; or not. It&apos;s for real, I&apos;m just going to tell you now.</p><p>Some associations we have with color are certainly socialized as opposed to innate. For example, there&#x2019;s no reason for example to think the color blue &#x1F499;<em> </em>is associated with <em>trust </em>other than the fact that a million financial institutions use it.</p><p></p><p>And even that may be because of more innate associations like the calming effect of water or the sky when you&#x2019;re interacting with a survival-related and stress-laden topic such as money. Food for another day&apos;s thought, I suppose.</p><p>I would argue that whether or not any particular color association is innate or socialized doesn&#x2019;t matter. All that matters is if we have them or not, and the answer to that question is a just plain <strong>yes we do</strong>.</p><p>But let&apos;s take a quick bus ride over to an example. Think about the last time you tried a delicious new food.

Primary, secondary, tertiary colors and everything in between are all hues. You control the hue by selecting a position on the rainbow bar on the bottom, and then moving the selector all the way to the top right of the bar.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/2022/10/hue-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="The UI Designer&apos;s Guide to Color: 2022" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1100" srcset="https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/size/w600/2022/10/hue-1.png 600w, https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/size/w1000/2022/10/hue-1.png 1000w, https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/2022/10/hue-1.png 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="value"><strong>Value</strong></h3><p><strong>Value is the amount of black (shade) or white (tint) mixed with the color.</strong> You change the value by sliding up or down.

You can make every single visible color by adjusting these 3 properties. And from there, it&#x2019;s just a matter of practicing using it and building your color muscle.</p><p>Now knowing how to use the picker, start practicing your color-recreating abilities, but this time using a photo and the color picker. <strong>Try to recreate the color you see simply by changing the hue, saturation, and value.</strong></p><p>You will get better at this the more you do it, I promise. </p><p><strong>Eventually you&#x2019;ll be nailing colors and people will be paying you to do it.</strong></p><p>So, we&#x2019;ve covered the basics of color and how to create the colors you want. Now you might be wondering&#x2026; okay, but what colors do I use, and when?</p><h2 id="what-colors-to-use-in-your-ui-and-when"><strong>What colors to use in your UI, and when</strong></h2><p>So here&#x2019;s the thing. We know color affects how we feel. But what colors mean what? And how do you know when or when not to use a color?</p><p><strong>First you need to know that some colors take priority over others.</strong> This is because they are used to communicate very important information.</p><p>Let&#x2019;s take red for example, stop signs are red because red communicates arrest, intensity, and danger. Check out this dangerous stuff:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/79bduhiQMDniCO88b8nNvNQkYfrxcIJlKWlyG9rhDH9jePVEcW1e54ibBfJzvcvP9pFDj7ZeZiNrDU14dqOih4GLBdwEwHPRiuN9DNrzbz4gei0YPlmhhSOqK-_AXauppuaWwaiqaR0KgIdgsbpk_7PqjxtAy5xOyYIT8jwmZnsedflI1u2wtcQT4w" class="kg-image" alt="The UI Designer&apos;s Guide to Color: 2022" loading="lazy" width="624" height="429"></figure><p>That&#x2019;s not to say that everything that is red is dangerous. Tomatoes, for example, are a delicious red <em><strong>fruit </strong></em>(I said it) that are only dangerous when they&#x2019;re being hurdled at you in a tomato fight.</p><p><strong>But the effects some colors have on our psychology are distinct and pronounced, </strong>so you want to <em>try</em> to reserve them for very important use-cases. This isn&#x2019;t to say that you can&#x2019;t ever use red for anything else, though. Keep in mind that these are guidelines, and guidelines can be broken when the situation calls for it.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/N7IRNQ7tBgYsSS4I_MwansPhJ5WJXNIHSKxXbd4iS538Yzm0Iyel-UGOqHBlhEpN7yhZZ9dN8uA3UFPYJ1gWGv1DAGH3sLSkHsciba4o4erns8FmzUN7DhgYINim3GqJcDYkSg1GdDkK6XtHWpeQityO1aMD7my2nN2jO0tXDQeaWpEW_5sIE-btOw" class="kg-image" alt="The UI Designer&apos;s Guide to Color: 2022" loading="lazy" width="498" height="331"></figure><p>So here&#x2019;s a quick guide on when to use certain colors. Again, this is a set of guidelines intended to help you get started as a beginner, and guidelines, are&#x2026; well, guidelines. Use them until you feel confident about which ones are okay breaking and when (you&#x2019;ll build this muscle over time.)</p><h2 id="red"><strong>Red</strong></h2><p><strong>Common UI elements:</strong> Errors, when things are broken, alerts, alarms, critical problems, sometimes offline status, stop, destructive actions (like a &#x201C;delete&#x201D; button)</p><p><strong>Emotion &amp; brand associations:</strong> Danger, aggression, anger, passion, love, danger, &#x201C;stop&#x201D; sentiment, richness</p><h2 id="orange"><strong>Orange</strong></h2><p><strong>Common UI elements: </strong>Medium-intensity alerts, something needs attention</p><p><strong>Emotion &amp; brand assocations:</strong> Excitement, warmth</p><p><strong>Avoid:</strong> similar to red</p><h2 id="yellow"><strong>Yellow</strong></h2><p><strong>Common UI elements</strong>: not many</p><p><strong>Emotion &amp; brand assocations:</strong> Happiness, warmth, sunshine, caution</p><p><strong>Avoid: </strong>similar to red and orange</p><h2 id="green"><strong>Green</strong></h2><p><strong>Common UI elements:</strong> Online/active/positive status, done-ness (think checkmarks,) good to go, positive signals</p><p><strong>Emotion &amp; brand associations:</strong> Environment, natural, positivity, &#x201C;go&#x201D; sentiment</p><h2 id="blue"><strong>Blue</strong></h2><p><strong>Common UI elements:</strong> Typically only branded UI elements (buttons, etc)</p><p><strong>Emotion &amp; brand associations:</strong> Trust, calm, &#x201C;all good&#x201D; ness, security</p><h2 id="purple"><strong>Purple</strong></h2><p><strong>UI elements:</strong> Typically only branded UI elements (buttons, etc)</p><p><strong>Emotion &amp; brand applications:</strong> Richness, royalty, magic</p><p>Now that you know some of these associations, start looking for them in the apps and websites you use, as well as stuff out in the real world. If you&#x2019;ve never touched on this before, it might blow your mind how much subtle signaling is happening on a daily basis.</p><p>Which leads me to one of the most important points I will make:</p><h2 id="you-should-limit-the-number-of-colors-you-use-in-your-ui-design"><strong>You should limit the number of colors you use in your UI design</strong></h2><p>Color is obviously an extremely useful tool in design. That being said, it&#x2019;s easy to get excited and overdo the number of colors you have. I&#x2019;ll be the first to say it: once you get the hang of it, color is <em>fun</em>. I <em>love </em>color. But there&#x2019;s a direct relationship to the number of colors your UI uses and the complexity of your UI.</p><p><strong>As a reminder: color is a vehicle that carries information.</strong></p><p><strong>Complexity isn&#x2019;t necessarily bad. </strong>It&#x2019;s a good thing your glass-top stove puts red outlines where the burners underneath are so that you don&#x2019;t burn your hands every gee-dang time you&#x2019;re trying to make a meal. The red lines add complexity, but it&#x2019;s also <em>useful </em>complexity.</p><p><strong>In UI design, too few colors can also be unhelpful. </strong>You don&#x2019;t want your &#x201C;Permanently Delete Forever&#x201D; button to look the same as your &#x201C;Sounds good&#x201D; button.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/2022/10/uilab-confusingbuttons.gif" class="kg-image" alt="The UI Designer&apos;s Guide to Color: 2022" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="825" srcset="https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/size/w600/2022/10/uilab-confusingbuttons.gif 600w, https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/size/w1000/2022/10/uilab-confusingbuttons.gif 1000w, https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/2022/10/uilab-confusingbuttons.gif 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>In case it isn&apos;t clear... don&apos;t do this.</figcaption></figure><p>If it does, you may get people accidentally tapping it, deleting all their stuff, and getting rightfully frustrated at you for misleading them.</p><p>But too <em>many</em> colors is also unhelpful.</p><p><strong>As a rule of thumb, you want just enough color in your UI to carry the meanings you need. No more, no less.</strong></p><p>With that said, generally speaking, you&#x2019;ll need to consider <strong>4 basic colors</strong> when you&#x2019;re designing a new UI:</p><ol><li>Background color</li><li>Your primary, or main, color</li><li>Secondary, or accent, color</li><li>Semantic colors</li></ol><p>You may use variations within those colors, but you want to keep the total number of colors low.</p><p><strong>Also, just as a side note: primary and secondary colors in this context are not the same as primary and secondary colors on the color wheel.</strong> It just means your more important and less important color.</p><h3 id="1-background-color"><strong>1. Background color</strong></h3><p>Imagine you&#x2019;re painting the walls in your apartment or house. The background color is kinda like the base wall paint color you&#x2019;d choose for your interior walls. Its purpose is to serve as a backdrop for the stuff that goes on top or in front of it. Typically it&#x2019;s a neutral, white-based color, or a soft gray, and it&#x2019;s easy on the eyes.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/2022/10/uilab-wallcolor.png" class="kg-image" alt="The UI Designer&apos;s Guide to Color: 2022" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1100" srcset="https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/size/w600/2022/10/uilab-wallcolor.png 600w, https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/size/w1000/2022/10/uilab-wallcolor.png 1000w, https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/2022/10/uilab-wallcolor.png 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Notice how the wall color allows more dominant elements stand out.

In this way, the background color you choose is actually the foundation for the visual hierarchy of your app or website.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/2022/10/uilab-nike-bgcolor.png" class="kg-image" alt="The UI Designer&apos;s Guide to Color: 2022" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1100" srcset="https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/size/w600/2022/10/uilab-nike-bgcolor.png 600w, https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/size/w1000/2022/10/uilab-nike-bgcolor.png 1000w, https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/2022/10/uilab-nike-bgcolor.png 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Can you easily identify the most important parts of the screen and where Nike thinks you should look?

So it&#x2019;s important to be able to find things, read them, and use them, and therefore more important to use neutral colors for backgrounds. If you really love the color red, you might paint your dorm room red, but you wouldn&#x2019;t surround a red emergency SOS button in a red wall. Unless you&#x2019;re a horrible person.</em></p><p>It&#x2019;s best to stick with 1 background color, but feel free to include a variant or two. In certain circumstances, you may need 2 background colors. Imagine Google Docs, for example, where a light gray background creates definition for a white page, and then the white page creates definition for the content (text, photos.):</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/2022/10/uilab-googledocs-bgcolor.png" class="kg-image" alt="The UI Designer&apos;s Guide to Color: 2022" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1100" srcset="https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/size/w600/2022/10/uilab-googledocs-bgcolor.png 600w, https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/size/w1000/2022/10/uilab-googledocs-bgcolor.png 1000w, https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/2022/10/uilab-googledocs-bgcolor.png 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Google docs uses a light gray background color to outline the page, which then becomes the background for the written content.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="2-primary-color"><strong>2. Primary color</strong></h3><p>This is the color or colors you&#x2019;ll use for large areas of your UI. In most cases it is the primary color that is associated with your brand. For Coke, think red. It will often be used for things that are on top of and therefore surrounded by your background color, and may often contain text, so it should be clearly visible and high-contrast against your background color. Also consider how easy it is to read text that is inside it.</p><p>In some cases, your primary color will be used for large branded areas, such as a header, as well as buttons.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/2022/10/uilabco-fitbit-primary-colors-2.png" class="kg-image" alt="The UI Designer&apos;s Guide to Color: 2022" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1100" srcset="https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/size/w600/2022/10/uilabco-fitbit-primary-colors-2.png 600w, https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/size/w1000/2022/10/uilabco-fitbit-primary-colors-2.png 1000w, https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/2022/10/uilabco-fitbit-primary-colors-2.png 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Fitbit uses their primary color for dominant UI elements.

In that case, you might consider using another color that pairs well with your brand color for things like buttons (for example, if your secondary brand color is a rich black color, use that) or a shade of your primary brand color (in the Coca Cola example, a dark red) to increase the visibility of text against the button. </p><p>Or, you can use your brand color as an accent color instead.

These are purely functional in nature, and colors you&#x2019;ll want to reconcile with your color scheme at large.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/2022/10/uilabco-semantic-colors.png" class="kg-image" alt="The UI Designer&apos;s Guide to Color: 2022" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1100" srcset="https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/size/w600/2022/10/uilabco-semantic-colors.png 600w, https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/size/w1000/2022/10/uilabco-semantic-colors.png 1000w, https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/2022/10/uilabco-semantic-colors.png 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Now, all of this is only a guideline; over time you&#x2019;ll build a better sense of when and where you want to apply your color.</p><p>And I know what you might be thinking right now: wait a second, your primary color can be your brand color. But your accent color can also be your brand color? Which should I use for which?</p><p><strong>The cold hard facts: it&#x2019;s not a perfect science.</strong></p><p>Here&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;d recommend.</p><p>Start with a baseline of guidelines (60% background / 30% primary / 10% accent) and semantic colors (examples: errors = red,) and build on it over time. Each app and website is unique, and the more you practice using color, the more you&#x2019;ll build intuition of which color, how much to use, when, and where.</p><p>You may decide that you don&#x2019;t need a primary color in your design at all, and that you want your brand to come into play in the form of photos and accent colors. As with everything in UI design, context is important.</p><p>Nike is an excellent example of this: they made the decision to focus much of the visual attention on the photography of their shoes, since by nature, this is their &#x201C;product&#x201D;. The result? Most of their actual &#x201C;UI&#x201D; is white or light gray background. Their primary color is used for call to action buttons (aka Add to Cart) and they merely sprinkle in an orange accent color throughout the app:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/2022/10/uilab-nike-primary-accent-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="The UI Designer&apos;s Guide to Color: 2022" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1100" srcset="https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/size/w600/2022/10/uilab-nike-primary-accent-1.png 600w, https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/size/w1000/2022/10/uilab-nike-primary-accent-1.png 1000w, https://www.theuilab.co/content/images/2022/10/uilab-nike-primary-accent-1.png 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p><strong>At the end of the day, you need to do some of your own experimentation to get a sense for which colors to use where. </strong>Find examples of apps or websites you like, and copy them. Learn how many colors they&#x2019;re using, and see if you can find a pattern or a system.<br></p><h2 id="there-is-no-perfect-science-to-making-something-%E2%80%9Clook-good%E2%80%9D"><strong>There is no perfect science to making something &#x201C;look good&#x201D;</strong></h2><p>Unfortunately for those of us graced with the affliction of perfectionism, I&#x2019;m here to break it to you: you can&#x2019;t logic color past a certain point.</p><p><strong>The truth is, it&#x2019;s like learning a language.</strong></p><p>First, you learn the words. Get a sense for what words mean what, and when to use them. Then, you learn the rules. &#x201C;Never start a sentence with the word &#x2018;but&#x2019;,&#x201D; they say. &#x201C;But starting a sentence with &#x2018;but&#x2019; adds tonality to your writing!&#x201D; you say. See what I did there? You learn the rules, and then you learn how to break, or maybe more accurately, <em>bend</em> them.</p><p><strong>Unfortunately, there&#x2019;s no objective way to know if the colors you&#x2019;re using &#x201C;look good&#x201D;.</strong></p><p>You <em>can</em>, however, learn by paying attention to things that <em>you</em> think look good, observing how it&#x2019;s being done, and learning how to do it yourself.</p><p><strong>That being said, UI design is, first and foremost, about usability. </strong>Here&#x2019;s a practical checklist you can run through as you&#x2019;re working on something:</p><ol><li><strong>Can you read it</strong></li><li><strong>Can other people read it</strong></li><li><strong>Would the brand do it</strong></li><li><strong>Be kind to yourself</strong></li></ol><p>By running your designs through these checks, you can at least start to understand if your UI will be easy to read and use.</p><h3 id="1-can-you-read-it">1. Can YOU read it?</h3><p>Okay, so you came up with a color scheme, and you tried designing something with it. <strong>The first, fastest, most practical way to understand if your design works or not is a little closer to home than you think: yourself.</strong></p><p>You are, after all, a human being. That&#x2019;s all it takes to be a qualified user. So tap into your own user sensibilities, imagine you&#x2019;re not you&#x2026; and take a look.</p><p>What do you think? Is it easy to read? Is it easy to know what to do next? Do you know where to tap? If not: try to identify what&#x2019;s going wrong. Maybe one area looks right, and one doesn&#x2019;t.</p><p>There&#x2019;s no speed-running this process; it&#x2019;s how you have to learn.</p><p>Look at what you&#x2019;re doing, and look at examples of what others are doing where you don&#x2019;t get that prickly uncomfortable feeling. Compare them. Figure out what&#x2019;s different and try something else. Maybe it&#x2019;s a contrast issue. Maybe the colors just don&#x2019;t jive together.</p><h3 id="2-make-sure-other-people-can-read-it">2. Make sure other people can read it</h3><p>If you&#x2019;re not familiar with the topic, designing for accessibility is essentially the philosophy of designing things in a way that allows the maximum number of people to successfully use whatever you designed.</p><p>In UI design, this often plays out as making sure the contrast between certain elements in your design is high enough that is easy to read even for the most vision-impaired.</p><p><strong>Why&#x2019;s that a good idea? By designing something to be effective for those who would find it most difficult to use, we are putting maximum effort into designing it well</strong><em><strong>, period</strong></em><strong>.</strong> And if we can make life easier for more people, then we&#x2019;re doing our jobs well too.</p><p>A tool that you can use for this kind of accessibility checking is a contrast checker. There are many available, just be sure to use one that adheres to WCAG (<strong>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).</strong></p><p><a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/?ref=theuilab.co">I like this one.</a></p><h3 id="3-do-things-that-make-sense-for-the-brand">3.
